    "\n",
    "From the above, you can see your project knows where it lives, and it's hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level in the hierarchy is known as a _tier_.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Samples**\n",
    "5. **DataSets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project then takes a tree-like structure, from these tiers e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Home\n",
    "  |-WorkPackage\n",
    "  |      |-Experiment\n",
    "  |      |     |-Sample\n",
    "  |      |     |   |-DataSet\n",
    "  |      |     |   |-DataSet\n",
    "  |      |     |-Sample\n",
    "  |      |         |-DataSet\n",

    "  |-WorkPackage\n",
    "  |      |\n",
