    Essentially a global object that describes the state of the project for this interpreter.

    ----------
    project : Project
        reference to the current project object. Returns `None` if one not set yet.

    Warnings
    --------
    This object is a singleton, so only one instance can exist at a time.

    This object shouldn't be created directly, instead you should call `project.env('...')` to set its value.
